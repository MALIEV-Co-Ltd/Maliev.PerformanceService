# Maliev Performance Service

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build-Passing-success)](https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/Maliev.PerformanceService)
[![.NET Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-10.0-blue)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
[![Database](https://img.shields.io/badge/Database-PostgreSQL%2018-blue)](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Comprehensive employee performance management platform for goal alignment, feedback, and developmental reviews.

**Role in MALIEV Architecture**: The authoritative engine for talent development. It manages the complete performance cycle, including goal tracking, 360-degree feedback, and formal reviews, ensuring organizational alignment and employee growth within the Maliev ecosystem.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 10.0 (C# 13)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 18 with Entity Framework Core 10.x
- **Distributed Cache**: Redis 7.x (High-frequency feedback resolution)
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ via MassTransit
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.1 + Scalar UI
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry (Metrics, Traces, Logging)

## ⚖️ Constitution Rules

This service strictly adheres to the platform development mandates:

### Banned Libraries
To maintain high performance and low complexity, the following are **NOT** used:
- ❌ **AutoMapper**: Explicit manual mapping only.
- ❌ **FluentValidation**: Standard Data Annotations (`[Required]`, `[EmailAddress]`) only.
- ❌ **FluentAssertions**: Standard xUnit `Assert` methods only.
- ❌ **In-memory Test DB**: All integration tests use **Testcontainers** with real PostgreSQL 18.

### Mandatory Practices
- ✅ **TreatWarningsAsErrors**: Enabled in all `.csproj` files.
- ✅ **XML Documentation**: Required on all public methods and properties.
- ✅ **No Secrets in Code**: All sensitive configuration injected via environment variables.
- ✅ **No Test Config in Program.cs**: Test configuration in test fixtures only.
- ✅ **IAM Integration**: Self-registers permissions with the IAM Service using GCP-style naming: `{service}.{resource}.{action}`.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Performance Review Cycles**: Structured periodic assessment workflows (Annual, Probation) with self and manager review stages.
- **Dynamic Goal Tracking**: Real-time setting and progress monitoring of employee performance goals with complete history.
- **360-Degree Feedback**: Anonymized feedback engine collecting insights from peers, managers, and direct reports.
- **Performance Improvement Plans (PIP)**: Specialized tracking for supporting employee growth through structured check-ins and outcome monitoring.
- **Formal Recognition Workflow**: Transparent acknowledgement system for employees to formally review and sign off on performance outcomes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 10.0 SDK
- Docker Desktop (for infrastructure)
- PostgreSQL 18 (Alpine)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/Maliev.PerformanceService.git
cd Maliev.PerformanceService
```

2. **Spin up Infrastructure**
```bash
docker run --name performance-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:18-alpine
docker run --name performance-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:7-alpine
```

3. **Configure Environment**
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:ConnectionStrings__PerformanceDbContext="YOUR_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING"
$env:ConnectionStrings__Cache="YOUR_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING"
```

4. **Apply Migrations & Run**
```bash
dotnet ef database update --project Maliev.PerformanceService.Infrastructure --startup-project Maliev.PerformanceService.Api
dotnet run --project Maliev.PerformanceService.Api
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:5000/performance`. Access the interactive documentation at `http://localhost:5000/performance/scalar`.

## 📡 API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/performance/v1/`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/employees/{id}/reviews` | List all performance reviews for a specific employee |
| POST | `/employees/{id}/goals` | Set a new performance goal |
| POST | `/reviews/{id}/feedback` | Submit 360-degree feedback for a review |
| POST | `/employees/{id}/pips` | Initiate a Performance Improvement Plan |

---

## 🏥 Health & Monitoring

Standardized health probes for Kubernetes orchestration:
- **Liveness**: `GET /performance/liveness`
- **Readiness**: `GET /performance/readiness` (Checks DB and Redis connectivity)
- **Metrics**: `GET /performance/metrics` (Prometheus format)

---

## 🧪 Testing

We prioritize reliable tests over mock-heavy unit tests.

```bash
# Run all tests using Testcontainers
dotnet test --verbosity normal
```

- **Integration Tests**: Use real PostgreSQL 18 containers.
- **Contract Tests**: Ensure API stability for consumers.

---

## ✅ Validation and release boundary

Pull requests, `main`, `develop`, and `release/v*` tags run the same read-only
.NET validation workflow. Validation checks out immutable public revisions of
the MALIEV shared sources and restores only from NuGet.org, so it does not need
repository secrets or package credentials.

No workflow in this repository publishes images, authenticates to Google
Cloud, changes GitOps, or deploys to GKE. Release remains pending Aspire owner
review and must be introduced later as a separate, explicitly approved flow.
